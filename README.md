# Mind-Control
Presenting My Graduation Project. This project aims in processing and decoding imagined speech from EEG brain signals to be able to move a wheelchair to the four directions (forward, backward, left, right). Its just a milestone away, looking forward to completing this intresting project during my last semester.
